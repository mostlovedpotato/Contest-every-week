Here, we have to output the sum of number of dashes corresponding to each given digit.
we are given with the no. of dashes and then input having larger no . is not great idea instead we just take input int the form of 
the string and then we will covert that into number. Here, instead of using map or something else because the association is directly with
the index and so we ordered them according to their indexes otherwise we would have used map to store the corresponding result.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#define fast_IO ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(NULL), cout.tie(NULL)
 
int main(){
	string str;
	cin >> str;
	int sum = 0;
	int length = str.length();
	int arr[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};
	for(int i = 0; i < length ; i++){
		sum += arr[str[i] -'0'];
	}
	cout << sum;
}
